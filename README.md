# Rock Paper Scissors


Initialization:

The game begins by asking the user to specify the number of rounds they wish to play.
This information is stored for later use in determining the game's length.
Game Loop:

The game enters a loop that iterates for the specified number of rounds.
Each iteration represents a single round of the game.

User Input:

Within each round, the user is prompted to select their choice: rock, paper, or scissors.
The user's input is captured and stored for comparison against the computer's choice.

Computer Choice:

The computer randomly selects its choice from the three options: rock, paper, or scissors.
This selection is made using a random number generator to ensure fairness.

Outcome Determination:

The user's choice is compared against the computer's choice to determine the outcome of the round.
The classic Rock-Paper-Scissors rules are applied:
Rock beats scissors.
Paper beats rock.
Scissors beat paper.
A tie occurs if both players choose the same option.

Feedback and Scorekeeping:

Based on the outcome of the round, appropriate feedback is displayed to the user.
If the user wins, a green screen with a winning sound is displayed.
If the user loses, a red screen with a losing sound is displayed.
If the round is a tie, a yellow screen is displayed.
The score is kept track of, incrementing the respective counters for wins, losses, and ties.

Game End: 

Once the specified number of rounds has been played, the game loop terminates.
Statistics and Replay:

Upon completion of the game, the game's statistics are displayed to the user.
This includes the total number of rounds played, the number of wins, losses, and ties.
The user is then prompted to decide whether they want to play again.
If they choose to replay, the game restarts from the beginning.
If they choose not to replay, the game ends.

Random Number Generation:

The computer's choice is determined using a random number generator to ensure unpredictability.
This ensures fair gameplay and prevents the computer from using a deterministic strategy.
Scorekeeping and Statistics:

The game maintains records of the user's wins, losses, and ties.
This data is used to provide feedback to the user and allows for a more engaging experience.
